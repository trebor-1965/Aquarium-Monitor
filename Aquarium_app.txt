Aquarium App
SwiftUI

Description: This app is designed to help a user record aquarium parameters for marine, fresh water,
African Cichlid, Plant & Discus, brackish, and pond aquariums.
We want to be able to track:
1. Salinity
2. PH
3. Alkalinity dkh
4. Nitrate
5. Nitrite
6. Calcium
7. Ammonia
8. Last Water change date
9. TDS in ro/di Water
10. Ozone
11. Phospate
12. Temperature
13. General Hardness
14. Alkalinity

The user interface will be text and or voice.
I want to be able to use voice input to record the readings from the tests. 
User taps the mic icon and says "Salinity 1.20" and have the app put that in the Salinity
column. The user will be able to graph their parameters over time. use a value picker to
pick a list of standard values if needed, but if the value is outside of the normal values
then let the user enter what they need. While the program is active it can look at data 
trends and pop alerts if it sees and values getting to warning levels.

When the program starts it will open to the main screen with each water type;
Marine, Freshwater, African Cichlid, Freshwater plants & Discus, brackish, and pond. 
The user will be able to tap on which water type the want. They will be presented with a 
grid of parameters for their particular water type. It will show any
previous entries and a green plus button to add a new entry. The user will have the option to 
type in the value or hit the micro phone button on the keyboard and speak it in. The current
date will be added along with the entry. The user will have to option to change the date 
if they are trying to enter values for a previous date. 

Example:
Water type: Marine

Record Layout:
tank_id
tank_type
tank_name
tank_size
date_of_readings
temperature
PH
amonia
salinity
nitrate
nitrite
alkalinity
calcium
magnesium
phospate
last_water_change_date
last_filtersock_chaange_date
last_carbon_change_date
last_mediate_change_date

Program flow:
On start of program after splash screen, present user with menu:
1. enter new data
2. Look at existing records
3. Show graphs (if there are data saved.)

If 1 then 
	let user select aquarium type
	get aquarium name
	take user to enter testing results grid layout by reading type (ie: ph, salinity...)
	provide done button that will save the record or cancel that will back out
	have save button
If 2 then
    prompt (drop down list if more than one aquarium)
	bring up existing records for selected aquarium sorted by newest date
	use sortable grid view so data can be sorted by clicking on a column
	allow users to select a row and edit data. If in edit mode activate save and
	cancel buttons. 
	
	Need screen for data input
	Need something to store data in
	Need graph screen(s)
	Web links to aquarium sites
